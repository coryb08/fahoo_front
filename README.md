This app was developed, written, and designed solely by me, Cory Baker, for the purposes of:

* Demonstrating custom CSS design
* Demonstrating user-auth sign in flow
* Illustrating the use of React components and Redux store
* Illustrating how unique users and their unique articles can be organized with a Rails API

No boiler plates were used.

The idea is simple- if you choose to create an account, do so by clicking the Log in/ Sign up button. "Heart" your favorite articles refer back to them under the "Favorites" button in the user nav. This site is not yet secure, so please do not sign up with any secure information.
